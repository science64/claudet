![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unclecode/claudet/main/howto.gif)

## Why This Extension? 🤔
Hey there!

I don't know if you've felt this way, but I love using AI assistants like Claude. Recently, I found myself wishing I could talk to Claude instead of typing all the time. I enjoyed the speech-to-text feature when communicating with ChatGPT, and I wanted the same experience with Claude.

That's when I had an idea: why not create a Chrome extension to bring this functionality to Claude? I like Groq's super-fast Whisper model. So, I decided to create an extension.

This Chrome extension has been a great tool for me personally, making my interactions with Claude more natural and efficient. I hope it can do the same for you!

## Features 🚀

- 🎤 Adds a microphone button to Claude AI's text input area
- 🔄 Speech-to-text using Whisper model offered by Groq API or OpenAI
- 🔀 Switch between speech-to-text providers easily
- 🔒 Privacy-focused design with local processing

## Groq API and OpenAI - Speed and Accuracy ⚡
If you're looking for lightning-fast transcription, both the Groq API and OpenAI are excellent options. They use the Whisper model, which is known for its speed and accuracy. These options are perfect when you need quick, reliable transcriptions.
